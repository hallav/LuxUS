Folders containing the simulated data used in LuxUS: DNA methylation analysis using generalized linear mixed 
model with spatial correlation (Halla-aho and Lähdesmäki, 2020):

-simulated_data_design_matrices
-simulated_data_mub_1_4_minus1
-simulated_data_mub_1_4_minus2_3
-simulated_data_mub_minus1_4_1
-simulated_data_mub_minus1_4_2_3
-confounding_covariates

File naming system:
-Q = number of reads
-R = number of replicates for cases and controls respectively, the total number is 2xR
-set = data set ID, one data set corresponds to one genomic region
-cyt = in LuxUS sep. input files the input files contain only one cytosine, this is the cytosine index
-diff = indicates whether the genomic region is differentially methylated (DMR, diff1) or not (non-DMR, diff0)

The simulated_data_design_matrices folder contains the design matrices (in format accepted by RADMeth tool), 
one for each number of replicates.

The folders simulated_data_mub* contain the simulated data, separated into LuxUS (HMC & ADVI), LuxUS sep.,
metilene and proportion table input formats. Proportion table format can be used with RADMeth and the provided 
DSS, bsseq and M3D tools expect the data be in this format. Each of the zip files contains data for 100 DMR 
regions and 950 non-DMR regions. For the 50% DMR-proportion setting presented in the paper DMR sets 0-99 and 
non-DMR set 0-99 were used. For the 5% DMR-proportion setting the DMR sets 0-49 and non-DMR set 0-949 were used. 
The LuxUS and LuxUS sep. input files have been pickled and they can be used with run_LuxUS.py script as they are.

The folder confounding_covariates uses the same file naming system and the input files have been divided by format
in the same way, but there each data set has its own design matrix (as the continuous covariate is a random number 
and each data set is different.)
